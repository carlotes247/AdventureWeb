		<p>
		One of the key features of Adventure Web is the gold system. In Aera, nothing is for free. Beers cost money, swrords cost money... hell god even your wife costs money! There are many ways to obtain this mineral, but the basic you need to know is: 
		<strong>1 second of your time in Aera is 1 coin gold! </strong>
		</p>
		<p>Fantastic, right? Of course, there are more ways to obtain gold, but none of them are for free.</p>

		<p>
		Whenever you have enough coins, you can always ask the guards of your city to open the city gates and go and live an adventure! Obviously, the guards don't work for free, so they need to charge you a little fee. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Once you are exploring the vast lands of Aera, you can encounter one of the following things:
		<strong>
			<ul>
			<li>You can find more gold!</li>
			<li>You can find interesting characters </li>
			<li>You may end up in a trap and loose some money</li>
			</ul>
		</strong>
